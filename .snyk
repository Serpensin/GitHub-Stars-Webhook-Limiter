# Test files contain hardcoded credentials for testing purposes only

  code:
    - Tests/**
    - static/admin.js  # Exclude false positive XSS in blob URL download (browser-generated, not user input)
    - periodic_tasks.py:213  # SSRF false positive - URL is validated to be Discord webhook only

# Note: The blob URL XSS in admin.js is a false positive because:
# - The blob is created from a server-controlled response
# - The URL is browser-generated (blob://) and not user-controlled
# - It's only used for file download, never rendered as HTML
# - The filename is sanitized to prevent injection

# Note: The SSRF in periodic_tasks.py:213 is a false positive because:
# - The URL is validated to only allow official Discord webhook URLs
# - It must start with https://discord.com/api/webhooks/ or https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/
# - This prevents any SSRF attacks to internal or external services
