    - Tests/**
    - static/admin.js  # Exclude false positive XSS in blob URL download (browser-generated, not user input)

# Note: The blob URL XSS in admin.js is a false positive because:
# - The blob is created from a server-controlled response
# - The URL is browser-generated (blob://) and not user-controlled
# - It's only used for file download, never rendered as HTML
# - The filename is sanitized to prevent injection
